# Pokemon-Game
- This is a fan-made Pokémon Game (based on generation 1 and 2 of Pokémon)
- There are simulated battle where you can see each pokémon battle with each other until either team runs out of pokémon to fight
- I use this as a learning curve into how to learn and implement the math behind the game, which I will then use to learn Unity and UE5
